Hey {{.name}},
<br /><br />

My name is {{.engineer.Name}} and I'm one of the integration engineers at Bowery!
<br /><br />

My goal is to make sure you have an awesome experience with Bowery. If you're looking for a good place to start you can check out these links:
<br />
<a href="http://bowery.io/docs">Documentation</a>
<br />
<a href="http://github.com/Bowery/example">Example App</a>
<br /><br />

Take a swing at the example app and let me know what you think! This'll give you a really great idea of how easy it is to use Bowery. I'd love to hear your feedback from it.
<br /><br />

We can also get on a call or chat to talk more about Bowery and how we can most effectively integrate it into your current workflow. Is there a time that works best for you?
<br /><br />

And of course if you have any questions you can reach me via email.
<br /><br />

Thanks!
